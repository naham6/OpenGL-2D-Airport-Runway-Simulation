# 2D Airport Runway Simulation (using OpenGL)

A 2D computer graphics project built using C++ and the GLUT library. This simple project simulates an airport environment with interactive elements and animations.

## ✨ Features
* **Dual Versions:** Includes a basic plane design (Airportsimple.cpp) and a refined, realistic plane model (Airportsimple2.cpp).
* **Day/Night Toggle:** Press 'N' to switch between a sunny day and a dark night mode with bus headlights.
* **Interactivity:**
  * Press `Space` to boost the airport bus.
  * Press `L` to trigger a plane landing animation.
  * Press `R` to reset the scene.
* **Animations:** Moving clouds, flying birds (during daytime) and a rotating radar dish.

## 🛠️ Requirements
* VScode
* OpenGL & GLUT libraries

## How to Run
1. Install extension c/c++.
2. Install run++ to make it run easily(optional).
3. Compile and run the file.
