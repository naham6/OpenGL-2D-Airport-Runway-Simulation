# 2D Airport Runway Simulation (OpenGL)

A 2D computer graphics project built using C++ and the GLUT library. This project simulates an airport environment with interactive elements and animations.

## ✨ Features
* **Dual Versions:** Includes a basic plane design and a refined, realistic plane model.
* **Day/Night Toggle:** Press 'N' to switch between a sunny day and a dark night mode with bus headlights.
* **Interactivity:** * Press `Space` to boost the airport bus.
  * Press `L` to trigger a plane landing animation.
  * Press `R` to reset the scene.
* **Animations:** Moving clouds, flying birds (daytime only), and a rotating radar dish.

## 🛠️ Requirements
* C++ Compiler (GCC/MinGW)
* OpenGL & GLUT libraries

## 📸 How to Run
1. Ensure you have the GLUT headers and libraries configured in your IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.).
2. Compile and run `main.cpp` from either version folder.
